## Code Contribution ##

### Code style ###

We use prettier in cooperation with tslint for formatting our code and staying consistent in code-style. Formatting and linting can be run through the [NPM Scripts](#npm-scripts), or they can be integrated in your editor (like Visual Studio Code).

### Writing and Running Tests

This project is set up to use [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for tests. Create test files in directories called `__tests__` or with the `.test` extension to have the files loaded by jest. See the [the template project](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/App.test.js) for an example test. The [jest documentation](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html) is also a wonderful resource, as is the [React Native testing tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/tutorial-react-native.html).

### Branches ###

We follow these naming conventions:

* **master**: Production-ready code.
* **develop**: Development code.
* **release/***: Snapshot of a release.
* **feature/***: For developing new features.
* **bugfix/***: For bugs that are logged during testing.
* **hotfix/***: Only for hotfixing critical bugs from the `master`-branch.
